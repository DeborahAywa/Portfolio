# [Project 1: Credit Risk Assessment Using a Logistic Regression Model](https://github.com/DeborahAywa/Credit-Risk-Assessment/blob/main/Credit_Risk_Assessment_Using_Logistic_Regression_.ipynb)
## This project focuses on developing a data-driven credit risk model to accurately predict the likelihood of loan defaults. By conducting a thorough credit risk assessment, lenders and financial institutions can make informed decisions about whether to grant credit and if so, under what terms and conditions, thereby mitigating potential financial losses and ensuring the stability of their lending portfolios. By leveraging historical customer data, the model enhances the accuracy of creditworthiness predictions, leading to a higher-quality loan portfolio.
