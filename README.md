# [Project 1: Credit Risk Assessment With Logistic Regression Model](https://github.com/DeborahAywa/Credit-Risk-Assessment/blob/main/Credit_Risk_Assessment_Using_Logistic_Regression_.ipynb)
## This project builds a Logistic Regression model to predict loan defaults using historical customer data from Amdari's Apex Bank Dataset.
### Key Features
1. Predicts borrower's creditworthiness using a machine learning model.
2. Improves accuracy of loan default predictions compared to traditional methods.
3. Implemented in R programming language using packages like caret, tidymodels, and dplyr.
### Project Structure
1. Exploratory Data Analysis: Summary statistics of the dataset, visualizations to understand data distribution, key insights from the data
2. Model Development: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets and training the credit risk prediction model.
3. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset, utilizing confusion matrix and classification report
